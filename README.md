### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I am an aspiring Data Scientist who is especially interested in Natural Language Processing!

ABOUT ME
What sets me apart is my willingness to commit wholeheartedly to the acquisition of a new skill and all the associated knowledge that comes with it. My background is full of seemingly random endeavors, but what they all seem to have in common is DATA, Statistics, and Learning. I am committed to growing and learning as a person and a Data Scientist! 

Feel free to connect me to learn more! I hope to be putting a link to my projects soon, so watch out for that!

Looking forward to growing a productive network with the people here! I hope to create and discover truly magnificent things with all of you!
